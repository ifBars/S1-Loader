# S1 Loader - Advanced Branch Manager

## üìã Overview

The **S1 Loader** is a batch script tool designed to manage dual installations of **Schedule I** across both **IL2CPP** and **Mono** Unity backend branches. This tool enables developers and modders to seamlessly switch between different game versions while maintaining full Steam integration and update capabilities.

Unlike traditional approaches that require manual file copying with lose Steam integration, this tool uses advanced directory junction techniques and manifest swapping to provide a integrated development environment for Schedule I modding and testing.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Dual Branch Management**: Maintain separate IL2CPP and Mono installations simultaneously
- **Steam Integration**: Preserve Steam's ability to update each branch independently
- **Developer-Friendly**: Integrated workflow for mod development with conditional compilation
- **Safety First**: Backup creation and integrity verification
- **Zero Downtime**: Instant switching between branches without re-downloading
- **Automated Setup**: Guided configuration process for first-time users

---

## üß† Why IL2CPP vs Mono for Schedule I?

Schedule I, like many Unity-based games, offers different backend compilation options:

### IL2CPP Branch (Production)
- **Debugging**: Harder to debug and analyze
- **Modding**: Less accessible for modding
- **Distribution**: Standard release branch for end users

### Mono Branch (Development)
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug and analyze
- **Modding**: More accessible for reverse engineering and modding
- **Tool Compatibility**: Better compatibility with debugging and analysis tools (dotTrace)

Having both branches available allows developers to:
- Test mods against both runtime environments
- Debug issues with dotTrace on Mono
- Develop mods that work across both versions

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The Schedule I Loader uses a combination of Windows directory junctions and Steam manifest manipulation:

### Technical Implementation
1. **Directory Structure**: Creates separate folders for each branch (`Schedule I_il2cpp`, `Schedule I_mono`)
2. **Manifest Backup**: Preserves Steam's app manifest files for each branch version
3. **Junction Links**: Uses `mklink /J` to create seamless directory switching
4. **Atomic Operations**: Ensures Steam always sees a consistent game state

### Steam Integration
- Steam tracks installations via game folders and manifest files (`appmanifest_<ID>.acf`)
- The tool swaps these components atomically to switch active branches
- Each branch maintains its own update state and Steam integration
- No loss of achievements, cloud saves, or Steam features

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Schedule I installed via Steam
- Administrator privileges (for junction creation)
- At least 2x the game's disk space for dual installation

### Initial Setup
1. **Download the Script**: Place `s1-loader.bat` in a dedicated folder
2. **Run as Administrator**: Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator"
3. **Choose Option 1**: "Initial Setup (First Time)"
4. **Follow the Wizard**: The script will guide you through the entire process

The setup process will:
- Detect your Steam installation automatically
- Create safety backups of your current installation
- Set up branch folders and manifest backups
- Guide you through Steam branch switching
- Verify the complete setup

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Workflow with Conditional Compilation

The Schedule I Loader integrates seamlessly with Visual Studio and MSBuild for mod development. Use conditional compilation to build different versions of your mods for each branch:

### MSBuild Configuration

Add these PropertyGroups to your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Il2cpp'">
    <DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);IL2CPP</DefineConstants>
    <AssemblyName>YourMod_Il2CPP</AssemblyName>
    <ModsDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Schedule I_il2cpp\Mods</ModsDir>
</PropertyGroup>

<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Mono'">
    <DefineConstants>$(DefineConstants);MONO</DefineConstants>
    <AssemblyName>YourMod_Mono</AssemblyName>
    <ModsDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Schedule I_mono\Mods</ModsDir>
</PropertyGroup>

<Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="PostBuildEvent">
    <Exec Command="COPY &quot;$(TargetPath)&quot; &quot;$(ModsDir)&quot;" />
</Target>
```

### Code Example with Conditional Compilation

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

#if IL2CPP
using Il2CppInterop.Runtime;
using Il2CppInterop.Runtime.InteropTypes.Arrays;
#endif

namespace YourMod
{
    public class ModManager
    {
        public void Initialize()
        {
#if IL2CPP
            // IL2CPP-specific initialization
            Il2CppInteropManager.Initialize();
            Console.WriteLine("Mod initialized for IL2CPP backend");
#elif MONO
            // Mono-specific initialization
            AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += OnAssemblyResolve;
            Console.WriteLine("Mod initialized for Mono backend");
#endif
        }

#if MONO
        private Assembly OnAssemblyResolve(object sender, ResolveEventArgs args)
        {
            // Mono-specific assembly resolution
            return null;
        }
#endif
    }
}
```

### Build Configurations

Create the following build configurations in Visual Studio:
- **Il2cpp**: Builds for IL2CPP branch with appropriate preprocessor directives
- **Mono**: Builds for Mono branch with appropriate preprocessor directives

---

## üìÅ Directory Structure

After setup, your Schedule I installation will look like this:

```
SteamLibrary/steamapps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Schedule I/                    # Active branch (junction link)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Schedule I_il2cpp/            # IL2CPP branch files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Schedule I_mono/              # Mono branch files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appmanifest_3164500.acf          # Active manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appmanifest_3164500.acf_il2cpp   # IL2CPP manifest backup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appmanifest_3164500.acf_mono     # Mono manifest backup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
